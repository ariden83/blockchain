# Peer 2 Peer Blockchain Tutorial

### Getting started

You'll need to set up the `gx` package manager. If you don't know how to do that, don't worry. Hang tight and read the upcoming blog post.

In your 1st terminal `go run main.go -secio -l 10000`

Follow the instructions in your 1st terminal and copy and paste the given command into your 2nd terminal e.g. `go run main.go -l 10001 -d /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/10000/ipfs/QmZ8NayvdXc2U2A1cwh9qGaHK7uxXXVrZQEYwDqbfFydfj -secio`

Follow the instructions in your 2nd terminal and copy and paste the given command into your 3rd terminal e.g. `go run main.go -l 10002 -d /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/10001/ipfs/QmRAj9JJVKRJmWHbDKzvzKDVVFPWxuWYio3bPym4SgGPgF -secio`

Type a BPM into any of your terminals and watch your blockchain be broadcast to all terminals!
